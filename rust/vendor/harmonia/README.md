# harmonia

Harmonia is a binary cache for nix that serves your /nix/store as a binary cache over http.
It's written in Rust for speed.

## Features

- http-ranges support for nar file streaming
- streaming build logs
- .ls file streaming
  - Note: doesn't contain `narOffset` in json response but isn't needed for
    `nix-index`
- Add `/serve/<narhash>/` endpoint to allow serving the content of package. 
  Also discovers index.html to allow serving websites directly from the nix store.
- Content is compressed transparently with [zstd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd).
- Builtin TLS: when no frontend webserver is used, Harmonia can also provide TLS encryption

## Configuration for public binary cache on NixOS

### Using NixOS stable (from nixpkgs)

There is a module for harmonia in nixpkgs.
The following example set's up harmonia as a public binary cache using
nginx as a frontend webserver with https encryption:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  services.harmonia.enable = true;
  # FIXME: generate a public/private key pair like this:
  # $ nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key cache.yourdomain.tld-1 /var/lib/secrets/harmonia.secret /var/lib/secrets/harmonia.pub
  services.harmonia.signKeyPaths = [ "/var/lib/secrets/harmonia.secret" ];
  # Example using sops-nix to store the signing key
  #services.harmonia.signKeyPaths = [ config.sops.secrets.harmonia-key.path ];
  #sops.secrets.harmonia-key = { };

  # optional if you use allowed-users in other places
  #nix.settings.allowed-users = [ "harmonia" ];

  networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 443 80 ];

  # FIXME: replace this with your own email
  security.acme.defaults.email = "yourname@youremail.com";
  security.acme.acceptTerms = true;

  services.nginx = {
    enable = true;
    recommendedTlsSettings = true;
    # FIXME: replace "cache.yourdomain.tld" with your own domain.
    virtualHosts."cache.yourdomain.tld" = {
      enableACME = true;
      forceSSL = true;

      locations."/".extraConfig = ''
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_redirect http:// https://;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      '';
    };
  };
}
```

### Using the flake version (latest features)

To use the latest version with all features, import the harmonia flake:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.harmonia.url = "github:nix-community/harmonia";
  # ... other inputs
}

# configuration.nix
{ inputs, config, pkgs, ... }: {
  imports = [ inputs.harmonia.nixosModules.harmonia ];

  services.harmonia-dev.cache.enable = true;
  # FIXME: generate a public/private key pair like this:
  # $ nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key cache.yourdomain.tld-1 /var/lib/secrets/harmonia.secret /var/lib/secrets/harmonia.pub
  services.harmonia-dev.cache.signKeyPaths = [ "/var/lib/secrets/harmonia.secret" ];

  # All other nginx configuration remains the same as above
  networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 443 80 ];

  services.nginx = {
    enable = true;
    recommendedTlsSettings = true;
    virtualHosts."cache.yourdomain.tld" = {
      enableACME = true;
      forceSSL = true;
      locations."/".extraConfig = ''
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_redirect http:// https://;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      '';
    };
  };
}
```

You can use the binary cache on a different machine using the following NixOS configuration:

```nix
{
  nix.settings = {
    substituters = [ "https://cache.yourdomain.tld" ];
    # FIXME replace the key with the content of /var/lib/secrets/harmonia.pub
    trusted-public-keys = [ "cache.yourdomain.tld-1:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=" ];
  };
}
```

## Configuration format

Configuration is done via a `toml` file.
**Hint:** You don't need to interface with the configuration directly in case you are using the NixOS module.
The location of the configuration file should be passed as env var `CONFIG_FILE`. If no config file is passed the
following default values will be used:

```toml
# default ip:hostname to bind to
bind = "[::]:5000"
# unix socket are also supported
# bind = "unix:/run/harmonia/socket"
# Sets number of workers to start in the webserver
workers = 4
# Sets the per-worker maximum number of concurrent connections.
max_connection_rate = 256
# binary cache priority that is advertised in /nix-cache-info
priority = 30
# Whether to enable transparent compression with zstd.
# Note that this is incompatible with resuming, so don't enable this
# if any of your users are on a flaky connection.
# Default: false
enable_compression = true

# Allow to override the store path advertised in /nix-cache-info
# virtual_nix_store = "/nix/store"
# Allow to serve the nix store from a different physical location
# Default: empty
# Example: if you use `nix copy --store /guest` to populate a store than configure:
# real_nix_store = "/guest/nix/store"

# Path to the nix SQLite database. Harmonia reads store metadata directly from
# this file (no nix-daemon connection is used). Derived from the store layout
# by default; override only for non-standard state directories.
# nix_db_path = "/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite"
```

Per default we wont sign any narinfo because we don't have a secret key, to
enable this feature enable it by providing a path to a private key generated by
`nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key cache.example.com-1 /etc/nix/cache.secret /etc/nix/cache.pub`

```toml
# nix binary cache signing key
sign_key_paths = [ "/run/secrets/cache.secret" ]
```

Harmonia also reads the `SIGN_KEY_PATHS` environment variable which holds paths to secret keys separated by spaces.
All paths provided by `sign_key_paths` config option and `SIGN_KEY_PATHS` environment variable will be used for signing.

### TLS Configuration

Harmonia can serve content over HTTPS without requiring a reverse proxy. To enable TLS, specify the paths to your certificate and private key files in the configuration:

```toml
# Path to TLS certificate (PEM format)
tls_cert_path = "/path/to/cert.pem"
# Path to TLS private key (PEM format)
tls_key_path = "/path/to/key.pem"
```

Requirements for TLS certificates:
- Certificate must be in PEM format
- Certificate must be X.509 v3 (rustls does not support older versions)
- Private key can be in either PKCS#8 or RSA format
- Both files must be readable by the harmonia process

Example generating a self-signed certificate for testing:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/O=Organization/CN=cache.example.com"
```

Note: When TLS is enabled, harmonia will only accept HTTPS connections on the configured port.

### Logging Configuration

Logging is handled by [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing) and configured via the
`RUST_LOG` environment variable using
[EnvFilter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html)
syntax (compatible with the familiar `env_logger` directives). The default
filter is `info`. To only log errors use `RUST_LOG=error`, and to keep info
messages while disabling actix access logging use
`RUST_LOG=info,actix_web::middleware=error`.

## Build

### Whole application

```bash
nix build -L
```

### Get a development environment:

``` bash
nix develop
```

## Run tests

```bash
nix flake check -L
```


## Prometheus Monitoring

Harmonia exposes Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring and observability.

### Available Metrics

**HTTP Request Metrics:**
- `harmonia_http_requests_total` - Total number of HTTP requests (labeled by method, path, and status code)
- `harmonia_http_request_duration_seconds` - Request latency histogram with buckets ranging from 0.0001s to 1.0s

### Grafana Dashboard

A pre-configured Grafana dashboard is available in the repository at `harmonia-cache/harmonia-grafana-dashboard.json`. This dashboard visualizes:
- Request rate and latency patterns
- HTTP status code distribution
- Error rates and performance trends

You can import this dashboard into your Grafana instance to monitor your Harmonia deployment.

### Example Prometheus Configuration

To scrape metrics from Harmonia, add the following to your Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'harmonia'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-harmonia-host:5000']
```
